        "Music streaming platforms like Spotify generate large-scale audio and metadata signals that capture the structure, style, and popularity of modern music. In this project, we analyze a dataset of over 113,000 Spotify tracks to understand the factors associated with song popularity and to uncover latent musical patterns independent of genre labels. Our work combines supervised learning (predicting whether a song becomes a “hit”) with unsupervised approaches that reveal natural stylistic clusters derived purely from audio features such as energy, acousticness, danceability, loudness, and tempo. Through detailed data cleaning, exploratory analysis, clustering, and baseline modeling, we aim to quantify how musical attributes relate to streaming success and to map out the underlying structure of contemporary music at scale."

        "\n",
        "**Rationale:**\n",
        "- **The Long-Tail Problem:** Genre distributions typically follow a power law\n",
        "  - A few genres dominate (pop, rock, hip-hop)\n",
        "  - Hundreds of niche genres have very few tracks\n",
        "  - Rare categories cause:\n",
        "    - Overfitting in models\n",
        "    - Sparse one-hot encoded features\n",
        "    - Unstable statistical estimates\n",
        "\n",
        "**Solution - Top 20 + Other:**\n",
        "- Captures the majority of tracks (likely 80-90%)\n",
        "- Reduces dimensionality for modeling\n",
        "- Maintains signal from major genres while preventing noise from rare ones\n",
        "- \"Other\" category aggregates long-tail genres\n",
        "\n",
        "**Benefits for Modeling:**\n",
        "- More stable coefficient estimates\n",
        "- Reduced risk of overfitting\n",
        "- Faster training times\n",

        "\n",
        "**Observations:**\n",
        "- **Highly Right-Skewed Distribution:** The vast majority of tracks cluster at low popularity scores (0-20)\n",
        "- **Long Tail:** A small proportion of tracks achieve high popularity (60-100)\n",
        "- **Mode:** The most common popularity score is near 0, indicating many tracks have minimal engagement\n",
        "- **Sparsity at High End:** Very few tracks exceed popularity of 80\n",
        "\n",
        "**Implications:**\n",
        "1. **The \"Hit\" Phenomenon is Rare:** This confirms the wisdom of our binary classification approach - truly popular songs are exceptional, not typical\n",
        "2. **Class Imbalance Confirmed Visually:** The distribution explains why we see 28:1 imbalance in `is_hit`\n",
        "3. **Recommendation Systems Challenge:** Most tracks in Spotify's catalog receive minimal plays\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why This Matters:**\n",
        "- Validates our choice of popularity threshold (70) as capturing the elite tier\n",
        "- Suggests popularity may be driven by factors beyond just audio features (marketing, artist fame, playlist placement)\n",
        "- Indicates that predicting hits requires identifying subtle patterns that distinguish the tail from the mass\n"

        "\n",
        "**Strong Positive Correlations:**\n",
        "- **Energy ↔ Loudness (r ≈ 0.7-0.8):** Highly correlated - loud songs are typically energetic\n",
        "  - *Implication:* These features capture overlapping information; may consider removing one to reduce multicollinearity\n",
        "  - *Musical Intuition:* Makes sense - distorted guitars, aggressive drums increase both metrics\n",
        "\n",
        "**Strong Negative Correlations:**\n",
        "- **Acousticness ↔ Energy (r ≈ -0.6):** Acoustic songs tend to be less energetic\n",
        "- **Acousticness ↔ Loudness (r ≈ -0.5):** Acoustic tracks are quieter\n",
        "  - *Implication:* These define opposite ends of a production spectrum (acoustic folk vs. electronic/rock)\n",
        "\n",
        "**Weak Correlations with Popularity:**\n",
        "- Most audio features show weak linear correlation with `popularity` (|r| < 0.3)\n",
        "- **Conclusion:** Popularity is not driven by any single audio feature\n",
        "- **Implication:** Multi-feature models will be necessary; no \"silver bullet\" feature exists\n",
        "\n",
        "**Features with Low Intercorrelation:**\n",
        "- `Instrumentalness`: Largely independent of other features\n",
        "- `Tempo`: Minimal correlation with most features\n",
        "- `Valence` (musical positivity): Weakly correlated with others\n",
        "  - *Implication:* These provide unique information and should be retained\n",

        "  - Hits (is_hit=1): Slightly higher median (~0.65-0.70)\n",
        "  - Non-hits (is_hit=0): Lower median (~0.60-0.65)\n",
        "- **Distribution Spread:**\n",
        "  - Both groups show similar interquartile ranges\n",
        "  - Substantial overlap in the distributions\n",
        "- **Outliers:** Present in both categories\n",
        "\n",
        "**Statistical Interpretation:**\n",
        "- **Positive Association:** Hit songs tend to be more danceable on average\n",
        "- **Not Deterministic:** The large overlap means danceability alone cannot reliably predict hits\n",
        "- **Effect Size:** Modest - danceability shifts the probability but doesn't guarantee success\n",
        "\n",
        "**Possible Explanations:**\n",
        "1. **Playlist Dynamics:** Danceable songs may get added to popular workout/party playlists\n",
        "2. **Engagement Behavior:** Higher danceability might correlate with repeat listens (people dancing repeatedly)\n",
        "3. **Genre Effects:** Popular genres (pop, hip-hop, EDM) emphasize danceability\n",
        "\n",
        "**Modeling Implications:**\n",
        "- Danceability should be included as a feature (it has signal)\n",
        "- But it's one of many features - not sufficient alone\n",
        "- Likely interacts with other features (e.g., danceability + energy + valence might be predictive)\n",
        "\n",
        "**Recommendation:** Explore interaction terms between danceability and other features in advanced models\n"

        "\n",
        "**Visual Analysis:**\n",
        "- **Color = Cluster:** Each color represents one of the 6 clusters\n",
        "- **Spatial Proximity:** Songs close together in the plot have similar audio features\n",
        "- **Cluster Separation:** Well-separated colors indicate distinct musical groups\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Observations:**\n",
        "1. **Distinct Groupings:** The clusters form relatively separate regions - K-Means successfully found meaningful structure\n",
        "2. **Some Overlap:** Natural given we're compressing 10D → 2D; clusters are likely more separated in full feature space\n",
        "3. **Cluster Sizes:** Some clusters may be larger (more songs) than others\n",
        "4. **Outliers:** A few points from each cluster extend into neighboring regions\n",
        "\n",
        "**What This Tells Us:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Music Has Natural Structure:** Songs do cluster into distinct audio profiles\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Clustering Success:** The algorithm found meaningful groupings, not random assignments\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Beyond Genre:** These clusters are based purely on sound, not labeled genres - they may reveal cross-genre similarities\n",
        "\n",
        "**Further Analysis Suggestions:**\n",
        "- Cross-tabulate clusters with genre labels to see if clusters span multiple genres\n",
        "- Examine popularity distribution within each cluster\n",
        "- Sample songs from each cluster and listen to verify the audio profiles make sense\n",
        "\n",
        "**Conclusion:** The unsupervised clustering successfully revealed latent musical structure, demonstrating that Spotify's audio features capture meaningful dimensions of musical similarity.\n"

        "**Rationale:** This serves as a critical baseline model. Logistic Regression is simple and interpretable. Including StandardScaler ensures features are on a comparable scale, which is important for this algorithm. class_weight = 'balanced' is used to mitigate the class imbalance, preventing the model from being overly biased towards the majority class (non-hits). This allows us to establish a performance benchmark before moving to more complex models."

        "## Key Findings\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. Data Quality & Preprocessing\n",
        "- Successfully cleaned and enriched the dataset\n",
        "- Engineered meaningful features (artist collaboration counts, primary artist, hit classification)\n",
        "- Addressed outliers in duration and tempo while maintaining data integrity\n",
        "- Consolidated 100+ genres into top 20 + \"Other\" for modeling efficiency\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. Hit Song Prediction Challenges\n",
        "- **Severe Class Imbalance:** Only ~3% of tracks are \"hits\" (popularity ≥ 70)\n",
        "- **Baseline Performance:** Logistic regression achieved 75% recall but only 6% precision for hits\n",
        "- **Key Insight:** Audio features alone provide limited predictive power\n",
        "  - Popularity likely driven by external factors (marketing, artist fame, playlist placement)\n",
        "  - Need for more sophisticated models and additional features beyond audio characteristics\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. Audio Feature Relationships\n",
        "- **Energy and loudness** are strongly positively correlated (r ≈ 0.7-0.8)\n",
        "- **Acousticness** shows strong negative correlation with energy and loudness\n",
        "- **Weak correlation with popularity:** No single audio feature strongly predicts hits\n",
        "  - Danceability shows modest positive association with hits\n",
        "  - Multi-feature models necessary for prediction\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. Musical Structure Discovery (K-Means Clustering)\n",
        "- **Successfully identified 6 distinct musical clusters** based purely on audio features\n",
        "- Clusters show clear separation in PCA visualization\n",
        "- Each cluster represents a unique audio profile (high energy, acoustic, spoken word, instrumental, dance, live)\n",
        "- These clusters transcend traditional genre boundaries\n",
        "\n",
        "## Limitations and Areas for Improvement\n",
        "\n",
        "### Current Limitations:\n",
        "1. **Audio Features Only:** Model doesn't incorporate crucial external factors (artist popularity, marketing, playlist placement, social media)\n",
        "2. **Class Imbalance:** 28:1 ratio severely impacts precision - need advanced sampling techniques\n",
        "3. **Linear Model Limitations:** Logistic regression can't capture complex feature interactions\n",
        "4. **Temporal Dynamics:** Dataset is cross-sectional - can't capture trends over time\n"
